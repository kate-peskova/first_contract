# first_contract
First steps in creating and deploying a smart contract with Solidity.

In this project we will create a simple solidity smart contract, AssociateProfitSplitter.


## Background

Your new startup has created its own Ethereum-compatible blockchain to help connect financial institutions, and the team wants to build smart contracts to automate some company finances to make everyone's lives easier, increase transparency, and to make accounting and auditing practically automatic!
Fortunately, you've been learning how to program smart contracts with Solidity! What you will be doing this assignment is creating 3 ProfitSplitter contracts. Thanks to this contract you will be able to pay your Associate-level employees quickly and easily.
